//A number is said to be the Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to 
//the power of their respective positions is equal to the number itself.

//For example, 175 is a Disarium number as follows
// 1power1 + 7power2 + 5power3  = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175
//Some of the other examples of Disarium number are 89, 135, 518 etc.
